It was a typical day at the software development company, and two developers, Tom and Jerry, were sitting at their desks, coding away. But, as usual, they found themselves in a heated argument over the best development method - Agile or Waterfall.

Tom, an avid fan of Agile, claimed that the flexibility and adaptability of the method made it the perfect choice for any project. "With Agile, we can make changes on the fly and adjust to the needs of the client," he exclaimed. "It's like playing a game of chess, always thinking ahead and making moves accordingly."

Jerry, on the other hand, was a staunch supporter of the Waterfall method. "Waterfall may be seen as rigid, but that's exactly what makes it a better choice," he said. "It's like playing a game of checkers, following a set of rules and making sure each step is completed before moving on to the next."

Just then, the manager walked by and heard the argument. He decided to settle the debate once and for all by asking them to develop a small project using both methods. "The team that delivers the project on time and within budget will be declared the winner," he said with a smirk.

Tom and Jerry were determined to prove their method was superior, so they got to work. The Agile team started coding with a code block that looked like this:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log("Agile is the way to go!");
}
```

The Waterfall team started coding with a code block that looked like this:

```js
if (true) {
  console.log("Waterfall is the best method!");
}
```

In the end, both projects were delivered on time and within budget, and the manager declared it a draw. Tom and Jerry, tired from the argument, finally came to the conclusion that both methods had their strengths and weaknesses and that the best choice would depend on the specific needs of the project.
